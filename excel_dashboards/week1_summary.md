# ðŸ“˜ Reflection â€“ Week 1: Excel Foundations & Dashboard Practice  
**Date:** October 4â€“5, 2025  

---

## âœ… What I accomplished
- Practiced dataset cleanup (standardized headers, formatted names/columns, handled blanks with median values, duplicate checks).  
- Reviewed Excel fundamentals: sorting, filtering, IF statements, MEDIAN function.  
- Created multiple PivotTables for Titanic (survival by class/sex) and Superstore (sales, profit, regions, ship mode).  
- Built my first **Superstore Dashboard** in Excel with:  
  - 4 KPI cards (Total Sales, Total Profit, # Orders, Avg Profit Margin)  
  - 2Ã—2 grid layout of charts (Sales by Category, Profit by Sub-Category, Sales by Region, Quantity by Ship Mode).

## ðŸ“š What I learned
- Handling missing values requires context â†’ e.g., filling Titanic fares with the **median of the passengerâ€™s Pclass**.  
- PivotTables are powerful: beyond sums, they can show **% of totals** and support **calculated fields** like Profit Margin.  
- Dashboard design matters â†’ clear structure (Header â†’ KPIs â†’ Charts) makes data easy to understand.  
- Consistent color palettes (blue/orange/green/red) make visuals professional and reduce confusion.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I want to improve next
- Use **lookup functions** (VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) to automate tasks instead of manual fixes.  
- Add **interactivity** to dashboards (slicers, filters, dynamic pivots).  
- Continue practicing cleanup â†’ faster workflows and consistency across datasets.  
- Document progress better: commit cleaned datasets, dashboards, and reflections into GitHub as a growing portfolio trail.
